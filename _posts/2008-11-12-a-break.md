Without going into great detail about personal life getting in the way, I will say that between work and the requirements that come with being a dad, posting trivial musings to a blog seems rather unimportant to me. So at this point, I&#8217;m closing shop for a while. It&#8217;s actually been closed for some time, but I&#8217;m doing officially now.

This is most likely not a good bye, but rather a see-you-later. There may one day be a resurrection of sorts. Until then, thanks for reading and see you soon.
