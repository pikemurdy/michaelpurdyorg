On the eve of 2010, a look back on the decade. A lot of people like to look at how far technology has advanced or what they&#8217;ve accomplished at the end of a ten year cycle. I&#8217;ve decided to look back and think about some of the dumbest things I&#8217;ve said. Yes, I say at least 40 dumb things every day, but here are a few of the dumbest:

- **2000**. &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting married at 24.&#8221;
- **2001**. &#8220;An iPod? What is Apple thinking? They need to fix their OS, not mess around with MP3 players. That&#8217;s stupid; no one will buy that.&#8221;
- **2002**. &#8220;*Being There *was good, but I don&#8217;t see myself getting all excited and running out to buy a Wilco album the day it&#8217;s released.&#8221;
- **2003**. &#8220;Yeah, this house is small, but we&#8217;re not having kids so it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;
- **2004**. &#8220;Bush is gonna lose.&#8221;
- **2005**. &#8220;A free concert downtown every day? That&#8217;s too cool for Knoxville to sustain.&#8221;
- **2006**. &#8220;Look, I just got a cheap bike for commuting and a bit of excercise. I don&#8217;t want to mountain bike.&#8221;
- **2007**. &#8220;A kid? I don&#8217;t want a kid. I&#8217;ve never even held a baby.&#8221;
- **2008**. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never own an iMac.&#8221;
- **2009**. &#8220;A Snuggie? It really makes me sad to see someone spending so much money to advertise a product no one will buy.&#8221;

May this decade be less dumb.
