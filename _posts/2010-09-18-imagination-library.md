It&#8217;s not often that I talk about professional projects on this site (it&#8217;s a personal site, get it?). But it&#8217;s not often a designer gets a project like this. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a project that allowed me to have this much fun. Not only did I get to have a major part in the conceptualization, but I got to illustrate, design and assemble a book, shoot and edit the commercial, and even do a little hand modeling.

*It was tremendous fun*. And it had the added benefit of making me feel really good about my work: Not only did it turn out really well, but I have a son who receives a book every month from this program.

The project is a fundraiser for the Knox County Public Library&#8217;s Imagination Library program. The project comprised of a one-page website, and a 30 second television spot. You can see the television spot below.

**Fun fact**: I&#8217;m wearing Amber&#8217;s concealer on my right hand, because I had cut myself really badly during the assembly of the actual book.
