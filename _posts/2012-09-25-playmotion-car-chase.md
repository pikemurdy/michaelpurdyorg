### And now for a departure of sorts.

A few months ago, my son (then three years old) asked a simple question of how [Wallace and Gromit](http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/) was made. All of my attempts to explain it fell short. Nothing made sense to him, so I set my DSLR on my tripod and did a very simple test so I could show him.

More questions followed, and quite by accident a new project emerged. A game of sorts was invented, we would play with some of his toys and &ldquo;write&rdquo; a story which would be animated. 

It turns out that my son, being four years old, is a better writer than I am an animator. I was learning as I went along, and boy did I learn. But the project was fun, nonetheless and I thought it worthy of a post here.

#### Below are the results.
