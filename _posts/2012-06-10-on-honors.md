I was once working on a photo project and was fumbling around an old shed when I heard a man yelling at his horse. He was tending a 1.5 acre garden of corn which he still plowed with a horse-drawn plow. The horse he&#8217;d tied to a tree and he was now walking through his corn field. I quickly ran up through his garden?inadvertently trampling some seedlings along the way?and asked him if I may take his photo.

He only said yes. I apologized for stepping on his corn and he said it was no big deal. He stood there in his work clothes, gave half a smile and I took his photo. It didn&#8217;t turn out to be the greatest photo I ever took, but I liked it. I sent an 8"x10&#8221; print of it to him as a courtesy.

A few years later, I had forgotten all about it. That is, until the farmer died and he had a closed-casket funeral. I&#8217;ve been to many funerals and generally at such ceremonies is a photo of the deceased in their sunday finest. But at this farmer&#8217;s funeral, upon his casket was placed the framed photo I had taken of him a few years prior.

For the past twelve years I have been lucky enough to earn a living making things. And in those twelve years I&#8217;ve made all kinds of things, from posters to websites, from restaurant menus to packages for cloth diapers.

Some of the things I&#8217;ve made have been not-so-hot. Others have been pretty big successes. I&#8217;ve been proud of a lot of the work that I have done and I continue to do. Work I&#8217;ve done has been featured in magazines, it&#8217;s been praised and it&#8217;s won awards. I won&#8217;t list my awards and never will because that&rsquo;s a waste of time and it doesn&#8217;t help me in my creative process. I mention it here merely to say what was and remains the biggest honor I&#8217;ve ever received.

It seems that the photo I had sent him as a courtesy was his favorite photo of himself. And that is the still the biggest honor I&#8217;ve ever had for anything I&#8217;ve ever made.
