The DeBord Falls trail at [Frozen Head State Park](https://tnstateparks.com/parks/frozen-head) is one of our regulars. It’s not long, perfect for families with small kids. I’ve never seen it too crowded and the trails are well maintained.

Finding the trailhead is easy. Just drive past the campground until you dead end at Panther Branch Trail. One great thing about this walk is that there are clean bathrooms near the campground where you can stop before you hike.

There are actually two waterfalls on the trail. DeBord Falls and Emory Gap Falls. The trail to DeBord Falls is about as flat as you can get in East Tennessee. Generally, there are a few roots and maybe some muddy areas but the trail is wide (more of an old jeep road) and well maintained. Once you reach DeBord Falls (only about a half a mile in), there's a steep staircase down to the pool.

But if you want to see Emory Gap Falls, I recommend skipping DeBord and continuing on, especially if you are with children. They'll never want to leave the DeBord Falls pool. But don’t worry, you can hit DeBord on the way back.

Past DeBord Falls the trail gets markedly more technical and steeper. It's by no means difficult though, and Emory Gap Falls is only three-quarters of a mile past DeBord Falls. At Emory Gap, be prepared to view the waterfall from afar, or get ready to scramble up some rocks.

On the return trip be sure to stop at DeBord Falls of course, and bring some swim shoes for the kids. There is a large shallow pool below the falls that is perfect for hunting salamanders and crawfish.
